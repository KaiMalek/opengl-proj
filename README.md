# opengl-proj

As I said in my last commits description, I hit a wall with this project, Ill be recoding it into a new, better, more simple and more organized engine.
The reasons are, I skipped or messed up some major stuff like lighting, code/file structure, file/function/variable naming, in the beggining.

This took me over a month to make, lets see where another attempt will take me.
